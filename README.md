## About Dataset

### Features In Details

#### Temperature
- Temperature is a physical quantity that expresses hot and cold. It is the manifestation of thermal energy, present in all 
matter, which is the source of the occurrence of heat, a flow of energy, when a body is in contact with another that is colder
or hotter ( Mostly used Celsiuous as the measure ).

#### Dew point Temperature
- Dew point temperature is defined as the temperature to which the air would have to cool (at constant pressure and constant water vapor content) in order to reach saturation ( Mostly used Celsiuous as the measure ).

#### Relative Hamudity.
- Humidity is the concentration of water vapour present in the air. Water vapor, the gaseous state of water, is generally invisible to the human eye. ( Measure as % value )

#### Wind Speed
- wind speed is a fundamental atmospheric quantity caused by air moving from high to low pressure (measured by Km/h )

#### Visibility
- visibility is a measure of the distance at which an object or light can be clearly discerned. It depends only on the transparency of the surrounding air (Usualy Used Km as measure )

#### Pressure
- Pressure is defined as the force divided by the area perpendicular to the force over which the force is applied. Kilopascal (kPa), one thousand times the unit of pressure and stress in the metre-kilogram-second system. ( usualy measured by kPa )
